Install flask on to your system before running the application.
Then open the project directory in command prompt/terminal and execute the views.py program.
Then open your  web browser and open http://127.0.0.1:5000/add to ADD the documents.
The http://127.0.0.1:5000/add page asks for login just give the username as "Bharath" no password and then click the button.
Then open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to search the files.
If there is any error check the Files folder in the project folder to see if the files are uploaded.
Constantly monitor the terminal for updates and errors.
